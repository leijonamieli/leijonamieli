# Hey! This is my GitHub profile.

Name's Riku. I'm a first year college student in IT @ Keuda, with networking and programming as my main focus and goal for graduating.

I am interested in gamedev, and very passionate about video games and tech in general.

Who knows, maybe that's what I will commit to do after college.
Ay, see what I did there? Haha.

See ya out there!
